    "\n",
    "Assume you work for a large business and have access to all orders made in any given time period (download [orders.csv](http://www.uwosh.edu/faculty_staff/krohne/ds730/orders.csv)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this exact csv file when testing your code. The column headings are fairly self-explanatory. Your company wants you to find the big spenders for each month and country so they can market more heavily to them. Your goal is this: for each month/country combination, display the customerID of the top spender (i.e. the sum of how much that customer spent) for that month/country combination. The amount spent in each row is determined by multiplying the Quantity by the UnitPrice. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The InvoiceDate is in Month/Day/Year format.\n",
    "* An InvoiceNo that starts with a C is a return. You must ignore these rows.\n",
    "* A row may not have a CustomerID. These rows must be ignored.\n",
    "* I am *not* looking for month/year/country combinations here. There are two years worth of data and I am only interested in the month and country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final output file should contain the following data in this format: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Month,Country:CustomerID**\n",
    "\n",
    "The month must be a two-digit number (i.e., 01, 02, ..., 09, 10, 11, 12) and must be separated from the Country using a comma. The Month,Country portion is separated by the CustomerID using a colon. If there is a tie, you must print out all customers who tied separating the CustomerID’s by a comma."

    "## Problem 2: Words with exact same vowels\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is similar to the problem we worked on in lecture with a small twist. Instead of printing out how many times a word appears in the file, you want to print out how many words have the exact same type of vowels. For this problem, only the number of vowels matters and the case does not matter (i.e cat is the same as CAt). A vowel is any letter from this set {a,e,i,o,u,y}. A word is any sequence of characters that does not contain whitespace. Whitespace is defined as: space, newline or tab. All of the following are 1 single word:\n",
    "\n",
    "* cats\n",
    "* c@ts\n",
    "* ca7s\n",
    "* cat’s.and:d0gs!\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be the vowel set, followed by a colon, followed by the number of words that contained exactly the vowel set. The output will have one answer per line (see example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "‘hello’ and ‘pole’ both contain exactly 1 e and exactly 1 o. The order of the vowels from the original input word does not matter. Imagine the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hello    moose\n",
    "pole cccttt.ggg\n",
    "```\n",

    "We would end up with the following output:\n",
    "```\n",
    ":1\n",
    "eo:2\n",
    "eoo:1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The format should be as seen above: the vowels on each line are in alphabetical order, followed by a colon, then followed by the number of words that contained exactly those vowels. If there are words with no vowels, nothing is printed before the colon."

    "## Problem 3: Discovering Contacts\n",
    "\n",
    "On many social media websites, it is common for the company to provide a list of suggested contacts for you to connect with. Many of these suggestions come from your own list of current contacts. The basic idea behind this concept being: I am connected with person A and person B but not person C. Person A and person B are both connected to person C. None of my contacts are connected to person D. It is more likely that I know person C than some other random person D who is connected to no one I know. For this problem, all connections are mutual (i.e. if A is connected to B, then B is connected to A). In this problem, you will read in an input file that is delimited in the following manner:\n",

In all inputs, all people will be replaced with positive integer ids to keep things simple. The following is a sample input file:\n",

Person 4 is connected to 8, person 6 is connected to 8, person 3 is not connected to 8, person 7 is not connected to 8 and person 13 is not connected to 8.

Person 4 is connected to 9, person 6 is connected to 9, person 3 is connected to 9 and person 7 is connected to 9.
